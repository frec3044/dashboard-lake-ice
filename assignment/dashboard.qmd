<!--
Use the following chunk to process the data.
1. Clean up the data so it is ready for analysis
2. Calculate the slope and intercept for each lake.  The creation of a function and use of a map function is required for full credit.
3. Generate values for required for the 7 value boxes

## Row {height="20%"}

### Column 

<!--
Create a value box card for the number of lakes in the dataset
You will need to have already created a variable called num_lakes
--->


```{r}
#| content: valuebox
#| title: "Number of lakes"

list(
  color = "primary",
  value = num_lakes
)
```

### Column 

<!--
Create a value box card for the earliest measurement
You will need to have already created a variable called earliest_year
--->

```{r}
#| content: valuebox
#| title: "Earliest measurement"

list(
  color = "primary",
  value = earliest_year
)
```

### Column 

<!--
Create a value box card for the most recent measurement
You will need to have already created a variable called most_recent_year
--->

```{r}
#| content: valuebox
#| title: "Most recent measurement"

list(
  color = "primary",
  value = most_recent_year
)
```

## Row {height="20%"}

### Column

<!--
Create a value box card with the name of lake that is changing the fastest
You will need to have already created a variable called highest_slope_lake
--->

```{r}
#| content: valuebox
#| title: "Fastest changing lake"

list(
  icon = "sort-up",
  color = "primary",
  value = highest_slope_lake
)
```

### Column 

<!--
Create a value box card with the name of lake that is changing the least
You will need to have already created a variable called smallest_slope_lake
--->

```{r}
#| content: valuebox
#| title: "Slowest changing lake"

list(
  icon = "sort-down",
  color = "primary",
  value = smallest_slope_lake
)
```

### Column 

<!--
Create a value box card with mean slope across all lakes
You will need to have already created a variable called mean_slope
--->

```{r}
#| content: valuebox
#| title: "Mean Slope (DOY / year)"

list(
  color = "primary",
  value = round(mean_slope,2)
)
```

### Column 

<!--
Create a value box card with the predicted mean number of years to lose 1 week of ice
You will need to have already created a variable called year_decade
--->

```{r}
#| content: valuebox
#| title: "Number of years to lose 1 week"

list(
  color = "primary",
  value = round(year_decade,0)
)
```

## Row {height="60%"}

<!--
Add the data as a table.  The columns of the data frame named `slope_data` 
should be `lake name` and `slope`.  Use the code below as-is
--->

```{r}
 slope_data |>
  arrange(slope) |>
  mutate(slope = round(slope, 2)) |> 
  select(lake_name, slope) |> 
  datatable(
    colnames = c("Lake name", "Slope"),
    options = list(dom = 'ftp', paging = TRUE)
    )
```

### Column

<!--
Add histogram that shows the slope values from the different lakes
--->

```{r}
#| title: Histogram

```

### Column

<!--
Add a plot of your choice that you think would be informative for the dashboard
The plot must use the data on the slopes of the lakes and data in the JSON file 
that describes characteristics of the lakes (data/lake_metadata.json)
--->

```{r}
#| title: Add useful title for card

```
